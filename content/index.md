**Event Details:**

- **Where:** Hybrid Event. Online and In-person at [Paper Crane Lab](https://www.instagram.com/papercranelab/)

**About the Event:**

Creative Coding Santé is all about bringing together people who love to mix code and art. Each month, we meet up to explore how coding can be used creatively across different fields like education, media, research, and more. Whether you’re a seasoned coder, a curious artist, or somewhere in between, come join us!

**What to Expect:**

- **Short Talks:** We’ll have a series of short talks from folks who are doing cool stuff with code in various domains.
- **Informal Discussions:** After the talks, we’ll hang out and chat. It’s a great chance to share ideas, ask questions, and meet new people.
- **Pair Programming:** There’s also the possibility of some pair programming sessions. It’s a fun way to collaborate on projects and learn from each other.

So, grab your chai, get comfortable, and join us for an evening of code, art, and good conversation. Whether you want to learn something new, share your own experiences, or just be inspired, we would love to have you.
